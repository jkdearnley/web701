                We here at EGGcellent wanted to share our favourite cooking methods and recipes for the common ways 
                to cook eggs and we hope they help you as much as they've helped us!</p>

                <h3>Ramsay's Scrambled Eggs</h3> 
                <p>A favourite among the team here at EGGcellent!! 
                    Gordon Ramsay's take on scrambled eggs is a unique one, 
                    they're very creamy, with a smooth texture, and may seem undercooked
                    but trust us, they are not and you won't regret trying them!</p>

                <h3>Poached Eggs Done Right</h3> 
                <p>Poached eggs are fantastic, on their own, as a replacement for a fried egg and are the stable
                    cooking method in Eggs Benedict.

                <p>Boiling eggs may seem easy, but it can be difficult to perfect the method and
                    get the yoke consistancy you're after, which is why we've included it in this section!
