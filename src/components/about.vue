			<h1 class="text-center">A Little About Us!</h1>
			<p>EGGcellent began life back in 2015 soley by John Steviki. Though business is 
				fairly new, the farm has existed for much longer. John grew up as a poultry farmer and has run his own
				for 20+ years. It was when John realised too many of his eggs were being wasted and selling them and even giving
				them away to his friends and family wasn't enough, he decided to sell them on a larger scale at local markets.<br><br>

				Eventually it became too much work for 1 person to handle and hired a small team to distribute the workload. 
				EGGcellent is now comprised of John, 3 managers and 10+ farm-hands and graders.
