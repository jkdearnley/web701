			<h1>A Little About Us!</h1>
			<p>Blake Stevens and John Steviki started CompuXIT in 2011. The company 
			began life as a networking service provider operated in John's garage 
			as a side project to their current IT based jobs. A small database was 
			setup and the cloud storage services were offered to Blake and Johns' 
			friends and family </p>
			<p>While they charged them very little, if at all, they saw the potential 
			this garage hosted little business had and quickly moved the business 
			to a small rented office space in Nelson city in 2013. With minimal 
			advertisement, it didn't take the duo long at all to gain a reputation 
			around Nelson and the company's customer base continued to grow, with 
			regulars that now rely purely on CXIT's services. John and Blake left 
			their full time jobs to work soley on the increasing need for CXIT's 
			services. </p>
			<p>It didn't take long for the two to realise they needed more hands 
			to help out, and hired Alan, to assist in customer service and larger 
			scale jobs. The company moved once more, to a larger building in Nelson, 
			to accomodate the increasing number of server towers. CXIT now consists 
			of 4 knowlegable, skilled and able-bodied staff and have recently introduced 
			a website hosting service, to increase their customer base further.
			</p>
			<p>Here at CXIT, we offer the friendliest, fastest and most reliable 
			services available. We look forward to working with any and all of you 
			to help out with your needs</p>
